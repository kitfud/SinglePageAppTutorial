Starving Artist? Time To React With Single Page Apps! 

Introduction: 

The purpose of this tutorial is to walk through the key features of React JS and to outline the key features through the development of a very basic single page application. Furthermore, this tutorial is geared towards beginners and people who are new to web development and the architecture needed to develop web applications. The intention is to learn by doing, in terms of creating a functional app with multiple page views and host it on the Repl.it servers for the world to see. Repl.it was chosen as the environment to write code in because of the ease of accessibility and setup and also because it allows you to ‘host’ your completed work at a URL from the beginning. 

The tutorial also outlines an approach for designing a simple app in two parts which can be compared to creating an outline for a design and then filling it with ‘color.’ These sections are as follows:

Part 1:Creating A Barebones Single Page App With Create-React-App

Part 2:Styling the Single Page App Page Views
