<h1 align="center">Starving Artist? Time To React With Single Page Apps!</h1> 

<h2>Introduction:</h2>

The purpose of this tutorial is to walk through the key features of React JS and to outline some of the basics through the development of a single page application. Furthermore, this tutorial is geared towards beginners and people who are new to web development and the architecture/file structure needed to develop applications. The intention is to learn by doing, specifically by creating a functional application with multiple page views and then host it on the Repl.it servers for the world to see. Repl.it was chosen as the environment to write code in because of the ease of accessibility and setup, moreover because it allows you to ‘host’ your completed work at a URL address from the start. 

The approach for designing the application itself is organized into two parts and these sections are as follows:


<b>Part 1:</b>Creating A Barebones Single Page App With Create-React-App

<b>Part 2:</b>Styling the Single Page App Page Views
